### Project Title: **Multi-Tier VPC Architecture on AWS** 🌐

---

### Project Description

This project involved designing and implementing a multi-tier Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS) for a fictitious company, XYZ Corporation. The goal was to create distinct environments for production and development teams, showcasing my skills in cloud architecture, networking, and security configurations. 

**My Role:**  
As the lead cloud architect, I was responsible for the entire project lifecycle, including planning, design, implementation, and documentation. I utilized AWS best practices to ensure scalability, security, and high availability. 🚀

### Project Outline

#### Phase 1: Planning and Design 📝
- **Task 1:** Define project scope and requirements
  - Identify stakeholders and gather requirements.
  - Document the desired architecture for production and development environments.

- **Task 2:** Create architectural diagrams
  - Use tools like Lucidchart or Draw.io to visualize the VPCs and subnets.

#### Phase 2: Environment Setup 🛠️
- **Task 3:** Set up AWS accounts and IAM roles
  - Create necessary IAM users and roles for security.

- **Task 4:** Create VPCs
  - Provision production and development VPCs with appropriate CIDR blocks.

- **Task 5:** Configure Subnets
  - Create five subnets for production and two for development.
  - Ensure the correct configuration of public and private subnets.

#### Phase 3: Instance Deployment 🚀
- **Task 6:** Launch EC2 Instances
  - Deploy EC2 instances in each subnet according to the defined architecture.

- **Task 7:** Configure Security Groups and NACLs
  - Set up security groups for instances, allowing necessary traffic.
  - Implement Network ACLs for an additional layer of security.

#### Phase 4: Networking and Connectivity 🔗
- **Task 8:** Set up Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
  - Configure the Internet Gateway for the public subnet.
  - Create a NAT Gateway for the private subnets to access the internet.

- **Task 9:** Create VPC Endpoint for S3
  - Configure VPC endpoint for secure S3 access without going through the Internet.

- **Task 10:** Establish Peering Connections
  - Set up VPC peering between production and development environments.

#### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation ✅
- **Task 11:** Conduct Testing
  - Test connectivity between instances and ensure that security rules are correctly enforced.
  - Validate that instances can access S3 through the VPC endpoint.

- **Task 12:** Documentation
  - Create a README file on GitHub detailing the project setup, architecture, and usage instructions.
  - Document the steps taken for future reference.

#### Phase 6: Deployment to GitHub 📦
- **Task 13:** Prepare GitHub Repository
  - Organize the repository with clear folders for documentation, scripts, and diagrams.
  - Include screenshots and logs of the implementation process.

- **Task 14:** Publish the Project
  - Push the final code and documentation to the GitHub repository.
  - Add a project description and tags for visibility.
